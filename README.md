# Binding

## Overview
Binding is a unique and educational project aimed at allowing students to create a digital "book" by assembling a collection of their previous works into a cohesive and interactive website. This project is designed to apply and showcase the skills we have developed in web design and content creation, culminating in the creation of their first multi-page website.

The essence of Binding lies in its ability to transform written texts into an engaging, multi-dimensional digital experience. We curate our works, respond through our selections, and express themselves through the design of the website.

## Project Goals
* Curation and Assembly: We have selected our first work and two other texts that relate to it, creating a narrative or thematic flow that binds these texts together.
* Web Design: The project will involve creating a responsive website that includes a homepage, navigation system, and individual pages for each selected text. In this case, we have done the sketching phase of the process directly in code, instead of using Figma.  
* Interactivity and Responsiveness: The final website will be designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on mobile and desktop layouts (and anything in between).
* Personal Expression: Through design choices and the way texts are compiled, we have the opportunity to express our individual perspectives and design sensibilities.

## Project Structure
* Index (Homepage): This is the entry point of the website, designed to explain the concept and rationale behind the selection of texts.
* Individual Text Pages: Each selected text will have its own page, designed for readability and engagement.

## Technical Specifications
* Responsive Design: The website should be responsive, with layouts suitable for mobile, desktop, and print.
* Cross-Browser Compatibility: Ensure compatibility across various web browsers.
* Accessibility: The website should be accessible, following best practices for web accessibility standards.
* SEO Optimization: Basic SEO principles should be applied to enhance the visibility of the website.

## Tools and Technologies
* HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the website.
* Version Control (Git/GitHub): To track changes and collaborate if the project is a group effort.
